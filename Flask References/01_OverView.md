Flask Tutorial
    
Flask is a web application framework written in Python. Armin Ronacher, who leads an international group of Python enthusiasts named Pocco, develops it. Flask is based on Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. Both are Pocco projects.

Audience
This tutorial has been prepared for anyone who has a basic knowledge of Python and has an urge to develop websites. After completing this tutorial, you will find yourself at a moderate level of expertise in developing websites using Flask.

Prerequisites
Before you start proceeding with this tutorial, we are assuming that you have hands-on experience on HTML and Python. If you are not well aware of these concepts, then we will suggest you to go through our short tutorials on HTML and Python.

What is Web Framework?
Web Application Framework or simply Web Framework represents a collection of libraries and modules that enables a web application developer to write applications without having to bother about low-level details such as protocols, thread management etc.

What is Flask?
Flask is a web application framework written in Python. It is developed by Armin Ronacher, who leads an international group of Python enthusiasts named Pocco. Flask is based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. Both are Pocco projects.

WSGI
Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) has been adopted as a standard for Python web application development. WSGI is a specification for a universal interface between the web server and the web applications.

Werkzeug
It is a WSGI toolkit, which implements requests, response objects, and other utility functions. This enables building a web framework on top of it. The Flask framework uses Werkzeug as one of its bases.

jinja2
jinja2 is a popular templating engine for Python. A web templating system combines a template with a certain data source to render dynamic web pages.

Flask is often referred to as a micro framework. It aims to keep the core of an application simple yet extensible. Flask does not have built-in abstraction layer for database handling, nor does it have form a validation support. Instead, Flask supports the extensions to add such functionality to the application. Some of the popular Flask extensions are discussed later in the tutorial.
